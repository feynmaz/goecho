#  models

* Within an application, you will have application-specific data structures that you will need to persist to a database for instance. The <em>models</em> package will house the application-specific types.

* The <em>models</em> package is separated from bindings and renderings, as you may wish to have both binding types and rendering types be based on a common model. This structure will make this easier.
