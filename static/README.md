#  static

* The <em>static</em> directory will contain all static assets and content that is required for the application. In some cases, you may want to render HTML templates to the caller. In other cases, you may need to serve JavaScript or images back to the caller. Within our Echo project, all of the static content we will reference will live in this "package".
