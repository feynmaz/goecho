# middlewares

* The <em>middlewares</em> package is where we will store all of our Echo web application middleware code and business logic that is applicable for
more than one handler within our service

* Example middleware from our use-case diagram would be the "Verify Token" functionality, which will validate whether the requester is who they say they are.
